## Introduction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to detect the likelihood of thyroid cancer recurrence based on patient medical data. The model uses classification algorithms to make predictions, helping in the early identification of potential recurrence cases.

Key components of this project include:
- Data preprocessing and handling of missing values
- Implementation of multiple classification models
- Evaluation and comparison of model performance using various metrics
